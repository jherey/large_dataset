# Using Node.js to Read Really, Really Large Datasets & Files

### The Question
The 4 questions asked, and a link to the data set that the program was to parse through.

- Write a program that will print out the total number of lines in the file.

- Notice that the 8th column contains a person’s name. Write a program that loads in this data and creates an array with all name strings. Print out the 432nd and 43243rd names.

- Notice that the 5th column contains a form of date. Count how many donations occurred in each month and print out the results.

- Notice that the 8th column contains a person’s name. Create an array with each first name. Identify the most common first name in the data and how many times it occurs.
